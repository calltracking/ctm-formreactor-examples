# ctm-formreactor-examples
Simple examples of implementing CallTrackingMetrics FormReactors

## form-js.html
There are comments and TODOs in the code. You will need to create a basic FormReactor. You do not need to add any special fields. If you add your CTM Tracking Code and setup a tracking number, tracking source, and target number, you should be able to get visitor data.

## testing
You can use python to run a simple server. Run one of the following and browse to http://localhost:8000
### python 2.x
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
### python 3.x
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
